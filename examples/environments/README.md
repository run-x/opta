# Description

To get started with Opta, firstly you need to create an environment. This will
set up a kubernetes based infrastructure in your cloud account.

This directory has two environment files - one for AWS and one for GCP. Copy one
of these, edit for your use case and then run `opta apply --config <file-name>`.
Make sure your terminal has the correct credentials.
