description: Creates an AKS cluster and a default node pool to host your applications in
---

This module creates an [AKS cluster](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/) and a default
node pool to host your applications in. This needs to be added in the environment Opta yml if you wish to deploy services
as Opta services run on Kubernetes.
