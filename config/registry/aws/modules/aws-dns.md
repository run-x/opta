description: Adds dns to your environment

This module creates a [Route53 hosted zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zones-working-with.html) for
your given domain. The [k8s-base]({{< relref "#k8s-base" >}}) module automatically hooks up the load balancer to it
for the domain and subdomain specified, but in order for this to actually receive traffic you will need to complete
the [dns setup](/tutorials/ingress).
